# Mini
Netduino Mini
This directory will contain all working code for the Netduino Mini. This will include both Visual Basic 2010 code, and Visual C# 2010 code as well.
Anything written in code for later releases won't be here as the Mini is currently not supported. It now supports VS 2013. VB not tried out as
these devices aren't running 4.2 code.
